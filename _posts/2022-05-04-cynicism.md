People often don't realise, but making silly comments (even in thought) about how your coworker's plans for becoming an artist - or your friend's efforts to do more recycling - are doomed to fail is probably not making you look cool, nor smart, not even to yourself. Behaving cynically, at best, just communicates pessimism. But typically it reinforces our own close-mindedness<!--more--> and strains our relationships. Although harm to social life is already a pretty bad thing in itself, I'm more worried about the former effect, how harmful it is to our own way of thinking.

Cynic thoughts can happen in a variety of situations. Casually or formally, explicitly or subtly. We come across an idea we don't particularly like, then suddenly an impulse appears in our minds to dismiss it as silly, unimportant. Deep inside we know that there's more to it than it meets the eye, but the impulse to hammer in a knowingly simplistic and incomplete response is stronger. Finally it gets externalised in a tone of mockery. Soon, after several runs of the pattern, we have convinced ourselves of our own oversimplification.

In principle, there is nothing wrong in simplifying concepts for better accommodation in mind. However, cynicism intentionally twists them in favour of what the mind considers their most convenient aspects.

Wikipedia defines [Cynicism (contemporary)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(contemporary)) as 

> an attitude characterized by a general distrust of 'others' motives

and that 

> a cynic may have a general lack of faith or hope in people motivated by ambition, desire, greed, gratification, materialism, goals, and opinions that a cynic perceives as vain, unobtainable, or ultimately meaningless and therefore deserving of ridicule or admonishment.

As to why people resort to cynicism is not completely clear, although some possible causes and correlations are mentioned in the article. I can see how facing a lot of perceived unfairness in life can lead one to develop a cynic reflex. It could be some sort of coping mechanism. Dysfunctional families, communities and societies are, apparently, fertile ground for it. It is also not surprising that cynicism can appear more active in depression. 

Intuitively, cynicism seems like a way to avoid putting our model of the world to test when confronted with an idea that might challenge it, at the same time we try to communicate that it should be dismissed without further examination.

Where I grew up cynic attitudes were commonplace. Later, when experiencing lower cynicism environment, I realised how much psychologically stifling being around high cynicism can be. Not only that, it became obvious that social groups that work under high cynicism are guaranteed to be stuck with sub-optimal solutions for problems that require collective effort. Though it's hard to single out cynicism as the sole culprit for such problems, there is an apparent correlation between them.

It may be not straightforward to find out why and how cynicism occurs. However, if you are able to notice in yourself the impulse to use it and feel compelled to avoid it, you are doing yourself and those you interact with a favour.
