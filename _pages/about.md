You've found my public records. My name is Adriano Oliveira. Welcome! I hope you make a good use of it. Expect a broad range of topics, most leaning towards technology, software engineering and data.

Why this? I've been in front of computers screens since my early childhood, I spent a good chunk of my life studying them, and have been professionally engineering systems for them since 2014.

I love wondering and ranting about technology, specially how it affects our lives everyday more broadly and intimately. But occasionally about other stuff as well.
