Welcome! My name is Adriano Oliveira. You've found my public records! I hope you make a good use of it. Expect a broad range of topics, most leaning towards technology and software.

Why this? I've been in front of computers screens since my early childhood, spent a good chunk of life studying them, and have been working developing software for them since 2014.

I love talking and wondering about technology, but other stuff as well. Specially how it affects our lives ever more broadly and intimately.
