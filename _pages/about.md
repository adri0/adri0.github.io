My name is Adriano Oliveira. I have been working with software on the professional level since 2014. But I've spent time in front of computers
since my early childhood.
During this time I've drifted through a variety of topics and technologies. 
Mostly backend automation and data applications.

You can connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adri0__). I'm not much of a poster, but I try to 
retweet mostly interesting and relevant stuff about software.
