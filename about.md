Hi, I'm Adriano. Welcome! I hope you make a good of my records. Expect a broad range of topics, most leaning towards technology and software, but also about things I learned in life that I think could be important to share.

I have been professionally working with software engineering and machine learning since 2014. Despite the sheer volume of material about these topics available on the Internet, I still find that a thing or two can be highlighted.

I'm fond of wondering the _what ifs_ of life and ranting about how technology will save us or doom us all. I like to think of this place as my personal wiki, but for concepts I find useful for myself. Maybe it might be useful to someone out there as well.
